<p>I recently got hold of a <strong>Toshiba Canvio 3TB</strong> external hard disk drive and was
    trying
    to format it using <strong>Disk Utility</strong>. To my surprise, I encountered a rather weird
    error
    that mentioned MediaKit not having enough space to perform the operation. The exact error
    message
    being,</p>
<p>MediaKit reports not enough space on device for requested operation.</p>
<p>Though it initially felt like my brand new HDD was a waste now, the solve was not really
    rocket-science – rather pretty straightforward. So before I tell you how to fix this, let’s
    first
    try to understand what the error really meant?</p>
<h2>What’s the cause?</h2>
<p>This type of error is generally caused when your EFI partition is below <strong>200 MB</strong>.
    Mac
    requires an EFI partition of at least 200 MB to perform any Disk Utility function on an HDD. If
    your
    drive came factory formatted in NTFS, chances are your EFI partition would be lesser as Windows
    can
    work with a minimum of 100 MB.</p>
<p>What is <strong>EFI partition</strong> you ask? Well, the EFI system partition (ESP) is a small
    partition formatted with FAT32, usually 100 MB, which stores the EFI boot loaders for the
    installed
    system and applications used by the firmware at startup.</p>
<h2>So how to fix this?</h2>
<p>Before we begin,</p>

            <p>Please note that all data on the HDD will be lost. I do not take any responsibility
                whatsoever in the unlikely event that your HDD gets bricked. By following these

<p>Alright, now let’s fire up <strong>Terminal</strong> to get the name of the HDD you are trying to
    fix. Type the command below to list down all drives. Look for the label “<strong>external,
        physical</strong>” and note its Identifier. In my case it’s <strong>disk2</strong>. Could be
    different for you.</p>
<p><code>diskutil list</code></p>

        alt=""></p>
<p>Now let’s force unmount the disk (and all volumes on it) by typing in,</p>
<p><code>diskutil unmountDisk force <span class="has-inline-color has-light-slate-blue-color">disk2</span></code>
</p>
<p>And then write zeros to the boot sector by typing in,</p>
<p><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<span class="has-inline-color has-light-slate-blue-color">disk2</span> bs=1024 count=1024</code>
</p>
<p>You will be asked to enter your administrator password. Go ahead and do it. Note that entering a
    password in Terminal will cause your cursor not to move. Your input will be accepted anyway.</p>

        alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, let’s go ahead and partition it. Again, in my case it’s <strong>disk2</strong>. Could be
    different for you. Type in,</p>
<p><code>diskutil partitionDisk <span class="has-inline-color has-light-slate-blue-color">disk2</span> GPT JHFS+ "<span class="has-inline-color has-light-slate-blue-color">Canvio</span>" 0g</code>
</p>
<p>Where <strong>Canvio</strong> is what you want to name your HDD. This will also format your drive
    and
    make it ready for use.</p>

    <p>If for some reason, you are asked to enter your password again when performing basic
        functions on
        the HDD (like creating folders), unmount and then mount the disk again. That should resolve
        any
        issues.</p>
